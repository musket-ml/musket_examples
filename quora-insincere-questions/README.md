# Musket example for Quora Insincere Questions Classification competition

This is Musket example for [Quora Insincere Questions Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification)

Competition is aimed at predicting whether a question asked on Quora is sincere or not.

## Launching from console

* Ensure you have Python 3.6, as well as Musket and Kaggle python packages with their dependencies installed, Keras installed and configured
* In experiment root folder - `quora-insincere-questions` - in command line type `musket fit -d`. `-d` tells Musket to download dependencies - Kaggle Severstal dataset in this case - before launching experiments. If you have more than one card available - don't frget to add `--num_gpus=N` parameter, where N is an amount of your available devices

## Launching from DS IDE

You can also edit and launch this example using our [DS IDE](https://musket-ml.github.io/webdocs/ide/getting_started/)

## Modules and used capabilities

### datasets.py

This file contains dataset definions - methods decorated with `@datasets.dataset_provider(origin=...,kind=...)`. Such definitions can be generated by IDE based on a dataset

### callbacks.py

This file contains `make_predictions()` method marked with `@after_fit` decoration. Given method should be called after training our model and which is aimed at making final prediction for data from file `test.csv`. You can use `@after_fit` decoration to mark any method in any module from `modules` folder, which should be called after finishing model training.

## Results

After fitting and prediction finished, please find file `data/predictions.csv` in project folder.
